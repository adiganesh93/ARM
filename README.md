This project uses IBM Employee Attrition dataset to predict Employee Attrition.

Performed Association Rule mining algorithm on this dataset to find frequent itemsets which could help judge attrition.

Created a dash app for hyperparameter tuning. The paramaeter values can be set by the user. It shows their respective visualization along with the rules for those parameter values.

The app is deployed in Heroku. The link to the app is given below:

 Followed CRISP-DM process
 
 – Did Data exploration and applied descriptive statistics – Data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation: identiied potential data quality issues and ﬁxed them.
 
 – Ran association rule mining algorithm using default settings.
 
 – Fine tuned the model by experimenting with diﬀerent algorithm parameters.
 
 – Presented the most interesting and signiﬁcant rules which could predict “Attrition”.
 
 – Provided interpretations of the above chosen association rules and also discussed why I considered them interesting and signiﬁcant.
